### Badges

Upon arriving at PyCon AU on your first day, at Registration you'll be provided with a badge with your name. 

Please **wear this badge at all times** while at PyCon AU.

### Badge Preview

When you register for PyCon AU, you'll be using Tito. You'll have three fields to enter: 
 * First Name
 * Last Name
 * Company Name

We will use these three fields to make your badge. 

Want to know what your badge will look like? We've created a dynamic template to show you an *approximation* of what you'll get on the day.

You are free to use the *Company* field as you like, so long as the content doesn't violate our [code of conduct](/conduct) 

Please use this to test the length of the content you want to add, especially the "Company" field. 

<hr>
* Changing the fields in the following form will live-update the badge below. Requires JavaScript
* This a representation of what your badge will look like when given to you at registration
* This is NOT your actual badge
